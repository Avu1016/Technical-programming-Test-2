Explain why usabmithe late? and what is your student number?

I would first like to apologize for submitting late on Github sir. My mistake was that I misread the instructions about submitting on Github. I was penalized for submitting incorrectly for my assessment 1 and there was an option to submit via email. So I had decided prior that for assessment 2 I would rather use the email to submit as it seems to be the simplest way out. I didn't read the instructions with the understanding that it was compulsory to submit via github, hence I submitted via email. It was only upon having a conversation with a classmate that I came to realize that submitting via Github was compulsory this time around and I would like to humbly apologize for that sir.

My student number is 21938983.

Your email submission was also very late Avumile, you will be marked though but be aware that you will be penalized!
