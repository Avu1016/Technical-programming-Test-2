You can see that if there is no water in the house, there is nothing you can do without water because everything you do, you do with water.

The third problem is the light, as I said we do not have a proper house and I wish to have a proper light. the light, which is stable, if the is a loadshadding, is a loadshadding. when you are cooking sometimes the wire burn. when we are cooking during the evening time after all workers are back from work the electricity becoming very slowly. if it faulty have to wait someone to come and fix it for you and when it's raining the electricity effecting with water.","To answer that question toilet is very important. To shit we need a toilet, you cannot shit without a toilet. It is a place where you are by yourself, your mind goes the other way, and you have time to sit and think. So, a clean toilet, a proper toilet is important to a human being. You cannot think healthy if you are in a dirty toilet. Flush toilet is a clean toilet because by the time you are shitting you are able to think clearly. Clean toilet is very important because as we are human being, we eat and to clean our stomachs we need to go to a toilet because you throw your things around. This is like when you go to the bushes to release yourself, what are the children going to say.  Even when the children go to the toilet anywhere, it is not nice to see shit everywhere. It is not good to toilet everywhere because the green flies are going to come to your house and seat on your food, on your things, that is not good, and it is not healthy.
